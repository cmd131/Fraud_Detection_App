# Data Folder

This folder contains sample data for the Fraud/Spam Detection project.

## Overview

The project uses the HuggingFace dataset **`mshenoda/spam-messages`** as the primary training and evaluation dataset.

To keep the repository lightweight and within submission guidelines, **the full dataset is NOT included locally**.

Instead, a small sample file (`sample_spam.csv`) is provided to document the expected data structure.
