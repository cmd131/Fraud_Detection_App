## AI-Generated Content

### OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-4.1)

AI assistance was used for the following components:

**Code Development:**
- Writing code snippets for training loop implementation
- Data augmentation techniques and implementation
- Frontend integration code
- Code review and debugging assistance
- jupiter notebook

**Notes on AI Usage:**
- All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and modified by Caleb Donaldson
- Code was validated for correctness, security, and alignment with project requirements
- AI assistance served as a development accelerator, not a replacement for understanding
- If an entire file was AI-generated, the attribution is at the top of the file
- If a smaller section of a file was AI-generated, the attrubition follows the comment header of that section within the file
